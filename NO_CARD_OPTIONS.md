## 🎯 Recommendation

### If You Need Truly Free (No Card):

**Use InfinityFree** (000webhost closed in 2024):
- Basic but works
- No verification needed
- Good for testing/small projects
- ⚠️ May inject ads into API responses (see REGISTRATION_API_ISSUE.md)

### If You're Willing to Add Card (Just Verification):

**Use Railway or Render:**
- They only verify, don't charge
- $5 free credit/month (Railway)
- 750 hours/month (Render)
- Much better experience

## 📝 Quick Setup: InfinityFree (000webhost closed)

2. Sign up (no card)
3. Create website
4. Get FTP credentials
5. Upload Laravel files via FTP

## 💡 Alternative Approach

**Use Vercel for Everything:**

This requires rewriting your Laravel API as serverless functions, but it's completely free with no cards.
